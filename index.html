            <p> I was born and raised in Pennsylvania. I am a part-time full-stack developer student at We Can Code It Boot Camp.<br> I am also a full-time employee at Amazon. I am currently pursuing a new career in programming.<br>My goal is to become a software developer. I have experience managing in retail, coaching, and supportive of the mentally disabled.<br> I'm a hard worker, I make sure my work is done on time to my best abilities.<br> In my free time, I like to go to the gym regularly to work out or play a few basketball games.<br> I spend lots of time with family and friends, and I share a dog with my brother named Lucky.<br> I occasionally look after Lucky a few times a week.
